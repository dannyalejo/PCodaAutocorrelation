# P wave coda autocorrelation

This notebook provides the implementation of the *P wave coda autocorrelation* method in Python language, which was used in two publications below. We demonstrate the method with data obtained from an ice station ST01 in West Antarctica.

If you intent to use a part or entire code in your research, please cite at least one of the following articles:
